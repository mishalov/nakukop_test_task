# Test Task

### `yarn start`

run application on port `3000`

### `yarn mock`

Run mock-server that serve mocks on `5000` port

To test task with currencies please change `./task/currencies.json`

In conditions of catastrophic lack of time here no autotests. I really love jest and cypress but cant spend more time to this task.

Were used:

`storeon` - Store manager. Divided into modules;

`fp-ts` -functional programming library. First time in use by me, i have feeling like some functions could be short.
